* Secondary toolstrip to add, edit, delete, copy PW, copy UN and browse URL below listview.
* Fixed: When replacing the target DB in the dropbox it will be replaced twice so that the previous one (with the old PW) is lost.
* Fixed: If there are unsaved changes and the DB was saved in a new file it was claiming that there's are unsaved changed before the new database was opened.
